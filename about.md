I'm in my final year, studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've interned at multiple software startups, the most recent one being at [Lookout Mobile Security](https://www.lookout.com/) where I worked on the Security & Infrastructure team.

I enjoy solving problems using machines. I've recently developed interest in artificial intelligence by pursuing research in deep learning of neural networks with [Professor H.R. Tizhoosh](http://tizhoosh.uwaterloo.ca/). I also participate in [hackathons](http://devpost.com/shamak).

I am currently interning at [A9](https://a9.com) on the [Advertising Technology](https://a9.com/whatwedo/advertising/) working with large scale distributed systems.
