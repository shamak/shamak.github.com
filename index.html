    I am currently a Master's student at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> working with <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gwtaylor/">Graham Taylor</a> and <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/people-profiles/bryan-tripp">Bryan Tripp</a>. I am part of the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/neurorobotics-lab/">NeuroRobotics Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gwtaylor/">Machine Learning Research Group</a>. My research aims to develop a better understanding of artificial and biological neural processes. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I am generally interested in the interplay of computational neuroscience, machine learning and optimization. My current focus is on modeling certain statistical mechanisms that occur in the brain's visual stream.

    Before coming to graduate school, I majored in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. During my undergrad, I did research in machine learning with <a href="http://kimia.uwaterloo.ca/tizhoosh/">Hamid Tizhoosh</a> and <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dkulic/people-dana.html">Dana Kulić</a>, and in combinatorial optimization with <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/">Stephen Smith</a>. I've worked with the <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/product-search/">Search</a> and <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/advertising/">Advertising</a> teams at <a href="https://www.a9.com/">A9</a> and more recently, at <a href="http://morpheuslabs.co.uk/">Morpheus Labs</a> where I was advised by <a href="http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/member/shimon-whiteson/">Shimon Whiteson</a> and <a href="http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~jmessias/">João Messias</a>. Outside of research, I enjoy playing soccer, squash and cooking. I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat">Muscat</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman">Oman</a>.

    I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo in Computer Engineering. During my time at Waterloo, I enjoyed solving problems in industry and academia. I've worked with the <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/product-search/">Search</a> and <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/advertising/">Advertising</a> teams at <a href="https://www.a9.com/">A9</a>, among other companies. I have also pursued research in machine learning for human motion forecasting with <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dkulic/people-dana.html">Dr. Dana Kulić</a>, machine learning for image search & retrieval with <a href="http://kimia.uwaterloo.ca/tizhoosh/">Dr. H.R. Tizhoosh</a> and combinatorial optimization with <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/">Dr. Stephen Smith</a>.

  <p>
    I spent the summer of 2017 working as a research intern advised by <a href="http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/member/shimon-whiteson/">Dr. Shimon Whiteson</a> and <a href="http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~jmessias/">Dr. João Messias</a> at <a href="http://morpheuslabs.co.uk/">Morpheus Labs</a> in Oxford, United Kingdom. At Morpheus Labs, I worked on 3D scene reconstruction from monocular 2D image sequences.

    I am currently pursuing my Masters (MASc) in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/neurorobotics-lab/">NeuroRobotics Lab</a> and the <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gwtaylor/">Machine Learning Research Group</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/people-profiles/bryan-tripp">Dr. Bryan Tripp</a> and <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~gwtaylor/">Dr. Graham Taylor</a>.
