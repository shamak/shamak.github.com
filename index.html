  I'm a final year undergraduate, studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. 

  <p>My research interests lie in machine learning and its related fields. I have been involved in research with <a href="http://tizhoosh.uwaterloo.ca/KIMIA_Lab/kimia_lab_team.html">Dr. Hamid Tizhoosh</a> in deep learning for image retrieval, <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dkulic/people-dana.html">Dr. Dana KuliÄ‡</a> in deep learning for human motion analysis and <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/">Dr. Stephen Smith</a> in applied combinatorial optimization. I have had six internships over the past four years, the most recent one being at <a href="https://www.a9.com">A9</a>, where I worked on the <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/product-search/">Amazon Search</a> team, to generate semantic text embeddings using deep neural networks.</p>

  My non-scholastic interests include association football and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree">progressive metal</a>.
