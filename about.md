I'm in my final year, studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've interned at multiple companies, the most recent one being at [A9](https://www.a9.com/) where I worked on the [Advertising Technology](http://a9.com/whatwedo/advertising/) team.

I enjoy writing code to solve problems in both, industry and academia. I'm currently pursuing research in applied combinatorial optimisation under [Stephen Smith](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/index.html). I'm also undertaking a research project in deep learning for motion analysis, supervised by [Dana KuliÄ‡](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dkulic/people-dana.html).

I'm looking for an internship from September 2016 - December 2016.
