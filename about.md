I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've interned at multiple software startups, the most recent one being at [Lookout Mobile Security](https://www.lookout.com/).

I like analysing and solving problems using machines. I recently did a quick analysis of a [game strategy]({% post_url 2015-09-10-big-money-in-dominion %}) in [Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)) and a [text analysis of various US Presidential speeches]({% post_url 2015-09-09-mining-US-presidential-speeches %}). I also participate in [hackathons](http://devpost.com/shamak).

I'm looking for an internship from January 2016 - April 2016.
