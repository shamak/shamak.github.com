    I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Waterloo in Computer Engineering. During my time at Waterloo, I enjoyed solving problems in industry and academia. I've worked with the <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/product-search/">Search</a> and <a href="https://a9.com/whatwedo/advertising/">Advertising</a> teams at <a href="https://www.a9.com/">A9</a>, among other companies. I have also pursued research in machine learning for human motion forecasting with <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dkulic/people-dana.html">Dr. Dana Kulić</a>, machine learning for image search & retrieval with <a href="http://kimia.uwaterloo.ca/tizhoosh/">Dr. H.R. Tizhoosh</a> and combinatorial optimization with <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/">Dr. Stephen Smith</a>.
