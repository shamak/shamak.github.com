I'm in my final year, studying Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've interned at multiple companies, the most recent one being at [A9](https://www.a9.com/) where I worked on the [Advertising Technology](http://a9.com/whatwedo/advertising/) team.

I enjoy solving problems in both, industry and academia. I've been fortunate enough to have been involved in research with [H.R. Tizhoosh](http://tizhoosh.uwaterloo.ca/) in machine learning for image retrieval, [Dana KuliÄ‡](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dkulic/people-dana.html) in machine learning and robotics and [Stephen Smith](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~sl2smith/) in combinatorial optimisation.

I'll be interning on the [Search](https://a9.com/whatwedo/product-search/) Relevance and Ranking team at [A9](https://www.a9.com/) from September 2016 to December 2016.
